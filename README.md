# Privacy Audit

On-TV process, microphone-device and network metadata inspection with an optional bounded local event log.

**Public experimental release 1.1.0.** This repository contains only this module, its build tools and its installable ZIP. Unknown Core is a separate prerequisite; the legacy unkndigital/unknown-home repository is not the modular Core installer.

## Prerequisites

- Install only on a TV you own, with existing owner-controlled root and Unknown Core 0.8.0 or newer. No rooting exploit, LG credentials, firmware or service-login bypass is supplied.
- Keep independent recovery access and backups. Modules execute trusted code with root privileges; they are not sandboxed.
- Read [module behavior and restoration](MODULE.md), [owner-use boundaries](OWNER_USE.md), and [security limits](SECURITY.md).

## Build

On Windows, run **Build.cmd**. It checks Node.js 20+ and npm, installs locked dependencies, checks source and creates a validated module ZIP. It does not connect to a TV or publish anything.

    npm ci --ignore-scripts
    npm test
    npm run build

Output: dist/privacy-audit-1.1.0.zip and dist/SHA256SUMS.txt. PC architecture is independent of the TV JavaScript runtime. The initial reviewed candidate ZIP and its checksum are also at the repository root. Checksums verify bytes, not publisher identity or safety.

## Install

In Core, choose Install Modules from GitHub and enter https://github.com/unkndigital/unknown-module-privacy-audit. Select the module ZIP from Releases and review it before installation. Activation is a separate choice. You can also transfer the module ZIP to /media/internal/.unknown-core/modules-inbox through your owner-controlled connection. Use the module ZIP, not GitHub's automatic source-code ZIP.

## Updates

Use [Unknown Core](https://github.com/unkndigital/unknown-core) 0.8.2 or newer. Open Updates, choose Check for updates, then Review this module's available release before applying it. Updates retain saved module settings and ON/OFF state and create a local backup. Update Core first when required. Nothing updates unattended. Keep independent recovery access: backups cannot undo every effect of root code, and power loss can interrupt installation.

## Scope and Verification

Stops periodic audit sampling. Existing RAM log entries are kept until cleared or the TV reboots. Privacy and microphone blocks are controlled by their separate modules.

Only one LG C4 / webOS 25 owner-device has been used for integration checks. Other models and firmware versions are unverified. Workspace tests cover module contracts; this standalone build checks syntax, manifest rules and archive integrity without executing TV actions. A successful build is not proof of hardware compatibility. No TV logs, personal settings, keys, research payloads or private YouTube helper are included.
